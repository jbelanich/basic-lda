Basic LDA (Work in Progress)
==========

A very simple implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation in python. Implementation is based off of this [paper](http://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/papers/fast-topic-model.pdf) by Limin Yao, David Mimno, and Andrew McCallum. Created for self-learning purposes. It is surprisingly fast, especially when using [pypy](http://pypy.org/). But, I would like it to be faster :).

Data files located in the 'data' folder are from the 'Bag of Words' data set found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words), constructed by David Newman.
