Basic LDA (Work in Progress)
==========

A very simple implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation using python and the scipy/numpy/scikit-learn stack. Implementation is based off of this [paper](http://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/papers/fast-topic-model.pdf) by Limin Yao, David Mimno, and Andrew McCallum. Created for self-learning purposes.

Data files located in the 'data' folder are from the 'Bag of Words' data set found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words), constructed by David Newman.
