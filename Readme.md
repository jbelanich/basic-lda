Basic LDA (Work in Progress)
==========

A very simple implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation using python and the scipy/numpy/scikit-learn stack. Implementation is based off of this paper: http://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/papers/fast-topic-model.pdf. Inference is based off of Gibbs Sampling. Created for self-learning purposes, and meant only as a prototype for a quicker version.
